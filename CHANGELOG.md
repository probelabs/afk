## [0.6.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added
- **Read-Only Mode**: New operating mode for passive monitoring without workflow interference
  - Enable with `afk readonly` command or `/afk:readonly` slash command
  - Sends notifications for completed sessions without blocking or waiting for responses
  - Perfect for monitoring long-running tasks without delays
  - Operates independently from local/remote toggle cycle
- **Enhanced Mode Management**: Three distinct operating modes with clear purposes
  - **Local Mode**: Default Claude behavior with built-in prompts
  - **Remote Mode**: Full Telegram approval workflow with interactive buttons
  - **Read-Only Mode**: Passive notifications without intervention
- **Improved Toggle Behavior**: Toggle command now cycles only between local and remote modes
  - Read-only mode requires explicit activation via dedicated command
  - Maintains predictable toggle behavior while adding monitoring capability
- **Updated CLI and Slash Commands**: Full support for read-only mode
  - New `afk readonly` CLI command
  - New `/afk:readonly` slash command for Claude Code interface

## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-30

### Added
- **Heartbeat-based session expiration**: Sessions now actively report their status via heartbeats

  - Prevents false "expired" messages while hooks are actively waiting
- **Automatic hook cancellation**: Hooks automatically exit when switching from remote to local mode
  - No more hanging hooks when toggling modes

### Changed
